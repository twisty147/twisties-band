## Feature Implementations
This webdesign was done in a rush as I returned from my leave of absence and didnt have much time to complete it. Given more time I would implement a consistent modal dialog across the website. Also, I would integrate the google map api for the contact us page so that fans can see the physical office address of the band. I will introduce icons and consistent typography on the website. In addition, I will save my media files on a CDN platform for optimisation. 

## Accessibility
The HTML code provides a good foundation for an accessible website ensured that the HTML elements are used semantically. Use appropriate tags for headings , etc., lists , and other structural elements to provide a clear document structure. There are descriptive alternative text (alt attribute) for images. The website was tested using only a keyboard and all interactive elements were reachable and operable using keyboard navigation. The document language was specified using the lang attribute in the opening tag. This can assist screen readers in providing accurate pronunciation.

## Technologies Used
GitHub was used for version control. It allowed me to keep track of changes, and provides a centralized repository for the project.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a source-code editor that provides a rich development environment. It supports various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used VS Code to write, edit, and debug my code efficiently.

HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, and it was used to structure the content of the website. HTML5 provides semantic elements, which were used to enhance the accessibility and structure of the Twisties Band website.


CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was used for styling and layout. It allowed me to customize the visual presentation of the website, ensuring a consistent and appealing design across different devices and screen sizes.


Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides pre-designed components and styles. It was used to streamline the development process, as it offers a responsive grid system, UI components, and other helpful features, reducing the need for extensive custom CSS.

Font Awesome is a font and icon toolkit. It was used to integrate scalable vector icons into the website. Icons from Font Awesome were easily customized and provide a visually appealing way to represent different elements, enhancing the overall user experience.

Google Chrome, being a widely used web browser, was the primary browser for testing the website during development. I used Chrome's developer tools to inspect and debug code, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and a seamless user experience.
